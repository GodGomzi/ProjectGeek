# ProjectGeek 📋

A clean, responsive, and intuitive Kanban-style project management application built with React. This project was created as a personal learning journey to master front-end and full-stack development principles.

**Project Status:** In Development 🏗️

ProjectGeek is a task management tool designed to help users visualize their workflow and increase productivity. It features a drag-and-drop interface to move tasks between different stages of completion.

This project serves as a practical application of my skills in:
* React Hooks for state management
* Component-based architecture
* Modern front-end development practices

The goal is to evolve this from a client-side React app into a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application-> deploy it to cloud-> Make it live.

## 🚀 Features

* **- [x] Create Columns:** Dynamically add columns like "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done".
* **- [x] Add Tasks:** Easily create new task cards with titles and descriptions.
* **- [x] Drag & Drop:** Move tasks seamlessly between columns to update their status.
* **- [x] Local Persistence:** Your board state is saved in the browser's `localStorage`.
* **- [ ] User Authentication:** (Upcoming) Sign up and log in to manage your private boards.
* **- [ ] Database Integration:** (Upcoming) All data will be persisted in a MongoDB database.


## 💻 Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React.js
* **Styling:** TailWindCSS 
* **Backend (Planned):** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database (Planned):** MongoDB
